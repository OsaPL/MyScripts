# My scripts

Few small, personal scripts.

Simple installation instructions and requirements(only if needed):

audisrv:
	Resets audio service if it's stuck.
	
netrefresh:
	Rerfreshes connection. (sockets,IP etc.)
	
auto occ:
	Uses nvidiainspector to OC. Set for GTX 660M, 1085MHz, original 850MHz (needs to be put in the same folder as nvidiainspector.exe)
	
install_win_tweak:
	Deletes all unnecessary apps and services, speeds up Win10 and gives more free disk space. (to leave apps you want just respond n for no, or if you want do delete y for yes)

netswitch:
	A simple and quick switch to use between wifi and wired network
	
Spotlight_extractor:
	Batch script to copy and convert all Spotlight service wallpapers (only Windows 10).
	Additionaly if ImageMagick is installed, you can get them sorted by orientation.
	For my personal, still updating collection of the wallpapper (all are sorted), check out https://github.com/OsaPL/SpotlightWallpapers. Requirements: Windows 10,(not required)ImageMagick
